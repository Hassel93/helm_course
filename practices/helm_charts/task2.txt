2a.
For this task we build a helm chart for a webapp.
The web app works on port 80 and the image that you should use is "timdaha/cn_meetup_demo_frontend:1.0.1"
Use the label app=meetup as the selector for the service. 
Create a folder with the name task2.
Create the helm required files and folders in this folder. Do not use templating.
The name of the chart should be task2
Deploy the helm chart with the release name task2 and get access to the application through the service

How would you start ?

2b.
Now use template variables to set the replica port for the deployment with using the values.yaml
Deploy your new variant again. 
Which command do you need without a uninstall ?
Which commnand line option do you need because you update the values.yaml ?

At least set your replicaCount Variable as a console value
Ensure that you create now the number of pods that you will set with your replicaCount

Do you need the same command line flag as before ?
