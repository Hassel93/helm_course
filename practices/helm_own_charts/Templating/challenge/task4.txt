Write a helm chart with 2 deployment which will have the same code but different images and ports
One Deployment use "timdaha/cn_meetup_demo_frontend:1.0.1" and port 80 what you now.
The other one will use timdaha/solr:latest and port 8983 
The solr deployment need also secrets with ADMINPW=password and BACKENDPW=password
Create everything in a helm chart and make pod forwarding to the solr and login to it
with username admin-solr and the password that you set in the secret ADMINPW

Divide it into two helm charts and create a umbrella chart that has both charts as dependecies
