Copy your helm chart that you create in task 6
We will optimize it more and use more helm functioniality
We changed our helperstpl and implement a fizzbuzz algorithm
if replicaCount can be divided by 3 than the appName set to fizz
if it can be divided by 5 than the appName set to buzz
if it can be divided by 3 and 5 the appName set to fizzbuzz
in all other cases the old value will be used {{ .Values.appName | default .Release.Name }}
Install your chart again and try it with the values appName=appTest and replicaCount=3
Remove your release
